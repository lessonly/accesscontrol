      # as long as their namespace is different. The namespace can be

      # permissions, such as to group parts of a particular feature
      # in your application.

      # @param action_id [Integer, Array<Integer>] The action or actions we're checking whether the actor has. If this is an array, then the check is ORed.
      # @param object_type [String] The namespace of the given action_id.
      # @return [Boolean] Returns true if actor has been granted the permission, false otherwise.
      #
      # @example
      #   # Can the user perform the action with id 3 for posts?
      #   Accessly::Query.new(user).can?(3, Post)
