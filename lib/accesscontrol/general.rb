    # Ask whether the actor has permission to perform action_id
    # in the given namespace. Multiple actions can have the same id
    # as long as their namespace is different. The namespace can be
    # any String. We recommend using namespace to group a class of
    # permissions, such as to group parts of a particular feature
    # in your application.
    #
    # @param actor [ActiveRecord::Base] The actor we're checking for permission on.
    # @param action_id [Integer, Array<Integer>] The action or actions we're checking whether the actor has. If this is an array, then the check is ORed.
    # @param namespace [String] The namespace of the given action_id.
    # @return [Boolean] Returns true if actor has been granted the permission, false otherwise.
    #
    # @example
    #   # Can the user perform the action with id 3 for posts?
    #   AccessControl::General.can?(user, 3, "posts")
